Dynamic loader for OCaml.

Given a list of cmxs objects (typically only one, corresponding to a program
to execute), ld_ocaml scans the filesystem to find the available (.cmxs)
libraries, infers which are needed in order to load the objects, and then
proceeds to load them all in order.

How it works
------------
.cmxs files hold information about the interfaces they import ("imports_cmi")
and the implementations they are tied to because of inlining ("imports_cmx").
This information is an OCaml string associated to the "caml_plugin_header"
symbol which corresponds to a Marshal serialization of the header (see
ld_header.ml). ld_ocaml looks for .cmxs files and builds a DLL catalog
which is later used to resolve dependencies as needed.
